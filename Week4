* [Russian vigilante hacker: 'I want to help beat Ukraine from my computer'](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60528594)

  This BBC Tech News article sheds light on the Russia's cyberattacks on dozens of Ukrainian websites
  after the war was declared on Ukraine last week. The article unfolds the cyberattacks against Ukraine 
  government webistes by a team of Russian hackers by flooding servers with DDos attacks. According to 
  the article, the team of hackers have carried out bomb threat emails and disruptions on Ukrainian army's 
  live feed videos, on top of the DDos attacks. However, the article states that the level of these cyberattacks 
  are not as sophisticated and are of low-level. But that doesn't mean the cyberattacks are not doing
  any harm--according to the article, even the attacks that do not look as sophisticated cause significant
  damage to the Ukrainian security teams, who are already extremely busy and stressed.
